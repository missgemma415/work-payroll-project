Let me first check the current state of the project and then update the subtask appropriately.`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n• ExecutiveLayout serves as the foundation for all analytics pages, ensuring consistent Fortune 500 branding\n• The component implements mobile-first responsive design with bottom navigation for executive on-the-go access\n• Using Poppins for display and Inter for body text aligns with modern enterprise design standards\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nLet me update the subtask to mark it as completed and add the implementation details:`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n• Task Master's update_subtask tool appends timestamped notes to track implementation progress\n• The subtask remains \"pending\" until explicitly marked complete with set_task_status\n• This audit trail helps maintain context across multiple development sessions\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nNow let me mark the subtask as completed:`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n• Task Master automatically suggests the next available task after marking one complete\n• The system maintains a dependency graph - task 2 is now available since task 1 (its dependency) is done\n• Task 2 (QuickBooks integration) is already in-progress, showing collaborative development capability\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nPerfect! I've successfully:\n\n1. **Updated subtask 9.1** with detailed implementation notes about the ExecutiveLayout component\n2. **Marked it as completed** (status: done)\n\nThe ExecutiveLayout component is now ready at `/components/layouts/ExecutiveLayout.tsx` and provides:\n- ✅ Unified dark slate/gold Fortune 500 executive theme\n- ✅ Responsive navigation with breadcrumb system\n- ✅ Professional header with live data indicators\n- ✅ Mobile-optimized bottom navigation\n- ✅ Consistent typography (Poppins/Inter fonts)\n- ✅ Executive-grade animations and hover states\n\nThe system shows that **Task 2 (QuickBooks integration)** is currently in-progress as the next priority item. The ExecutiveLayout foundation is now ready for the next subtask: **9.2 - Implement dedicated NeuralProphet forecasting page**.\n\nWould you like me to start working on the NeuralProphet forecasting page that will use this new ExecutiveLayout component?\n</info added on 2025-08-28T15:17:20.489Z>",
