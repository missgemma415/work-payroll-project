        "details": "1. Save and close all active work sessions:\n   - Commit any unsaved changes to prevent data loss\n   - Document current working directory and active tasks\n   - Close any running development servers or processes\n\n2. Restart Claude Code application:\n   - Fully quit Claude Code application (Cmd+Q on macOS)\n   - Wait 5 seconds to ensure complete shutdownington   - Relaunch Claude Code from Applications or terminal\n   - Verify all 10 MCP servers initialize successfully in startup logs\n\n3. Verify individual MCP server connections:\n   - Serena MCP: Run 'Analyze codebase structure' to verify code analysis capabilities\n   - Desktop Commander: Execute 'List files in directory' to confirm file system access\n   - Memory MCP: Test with 'Remember that Serena MCP was successfully configured'\n   - GitHub MCP: Check with 'Show my repositories' to verify GitHub integration\n   - Neon MCP: Query with 'Show database schema' to confirm database connectivity\n   - Sequential Thinking: Test with 'Break down the MCP integration process step by step'\n   - Fetch MCP: Try 'Fetch content from https://example.com' for web retrieval\n   - Puppeteer MCP: Execute 'Take a screenshot of localhost:3000' if dev server running\n   - Playwright MCP: Test browser automation readiness\n   - Taskmaster AI: Run 'Show next task to work on' to verify task management\n\n4. Test inter-MCP server interactions:\n   - Use Serena to analyze code, then have Memory MCP remember the analysis results\n   - Use Desktop Commander to list project files, then have Taskmaster create tasks based on findings\n   - Fetch web content and have Sequential Thinking analyze it step-by-step\n   - Query database with Neon MCP and use Memory to store important query results\n\n5. Validate configuration persistence:\n   - Check ~/.claude.json for global MCP configurations\n   - Verify .claude_mcp.json in project directory contains all 10 server configurations\n   - Confirm .claude/memory/memory.json is accessible and writable\n   - Validate environment variables are properly loaded (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN, etc.)\n\n6. Performance and integration testing:\n   - Monitor CPU and memory usage during MCP operations\n   - Test concurrent MCP server operations (e.g., analyzing code while fetching web content)\n   - Verify error handling when an MCP server is temporarily unavailable\n   - Confirm graceful degradation if one MCP server fails\n\n7. Document verification results:\n   - Create a checklist of all 10 MCP servers with pass/fail status\n   - Note any configuration adjustments needed\n   - Record response times for each MCP server operation\n   - Document any error messages or warnings encountered",
        "testStrategy": "1. Initial startup verification:\n   - Check Claude Code logs for successful initialization of all 10 MCP servers\n   - Verify no error messages during startup sequence\n   - Confirm all server processes are running (check process list)\n\n2. Individual server functionality tests:\n   - For each MCP server, execute at least 2 different commands to verify full functionality\n   - Document response time and accuracy of results\n   - Test error handling by providing invalid inputs\n\n3. Integration testing checklist:\n   - ✓ Serena analyzes lib/database.ts and Memory remembers the analysis\n   - ✓ Desktop Commander lists payroll-files-only/ and Taskmaster creates processing task\n   - ✓ Neon queries employee_costs table and Sequential Thinking analyzes the results\n   - ✓ GitHub shows repository info and Fetch retrieves README from GitHub URL\n   - ✓ Puppeteer screenshots dashboard and Playwright verifies responsive design\n\n4. Performance benchmarks:\n   - All MCP server responses should complete within 5 seconds for basic operations\n   - Memory usage should not exceed baseline by more than 500MB with all servers active\n   - Concurrent operations should not cause timeouts or crashes\n\n5. Configuration validation:\n   - Verify uvx commands for Python-based MCPs (Serena, Fetch) are in PATH\n   - Confirm npx commands for Node-based MCPs have required packages installed\n   - Test that all API tokens and credentials are properly loaded\n\n6. Regression testing:\n   - Ensure existing functionality still works (npm run dev, database connections)\n   - Verify no conflicts between MCP servers and existing project dependencies\n   - Test that all previous tasks' implementations remain functional\n\n7. Create verification report with:\n   - Timestamp of restart and verification\n   - List of all MCP servers with version numbers\n   - Success/failure status for each test\n   - Any recommendations for configuration improvements",
