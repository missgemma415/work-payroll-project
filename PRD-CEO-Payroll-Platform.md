2. **File Upload System** â†’ Need way to get data in
3. **CSV Parser** â†’ Must read uploaded files
4. **Data Validation** â†’ Ensure data quality

### Core Functionality (Build Second)
1. **File Type Detection** â†’ SpringAhead vs Paychex
2. **Data Processing Engine** â†’ Calculate costs and burden
3. **Database Storage** â†’ Save processed data
4. **Basic Dashboard** â†’ Show data to users

### User Interface (Build Third)
1. **Responsive Layout** â†’ Mobile-first design
2. **KPI Cards** â†’ Executive metrics
3. **Employee Table** â†’ Detailed cost view
4. **Action Buttons** â†’ Process, refresh, export

### Enhancements (Build Fourth)
1. **Excel Export** â†’ Based on existing data
2. **Sorting/Filtering** â†’ Requires working table
3. **Charts/Graphs** â†’ Needs historical data
4. **Notifications** â†’ After core features work

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges

**Risk 1: Large File Processing**
â€¢ **Problem:** Files with 10,000+ rows might timeout
â€¢ **Impact:** System appears frozen, user frustrated
â€¢ **Mitigation:** 
  - Add progress indicator
  - Process in batches of 500 rows
  - Use background jobs for large files

**Risk 2: Data Format Changes**
â€¢ **Problem:** SpringAhead/Paychex might change CSV format
â€¢ **Impact:** Processing fails, no data updates
â€¢ **Mitigation:**
  - Build flexible parser
  - Add format validation
  - Email alerts when parsing fails

**Risk 3: Database Performance**
â€¢ **Problem:** Queries slow down with more data
â€¢ **Impact:** Dashboard loads slowly
â€¢ **Mitigation:**
  - Add database indexes
  - Cache frequently accessed data
  - Archive old data after 2 years

### Figuring Out the MVP

**Risk: Building Too Much**
â€¢ **Problem:** Trying to build everything at once
â€¢ **Solution:** Start with just file upload and cost display
â€¢ **Success Metric:** CEO can see total monthly cost

**Risk: Missing Critical Feature**
â€¢ **Problem:** MVP doesn't provide enough value
â€¢ **Solution:** Focus on one key metric (true cost)
â€¢ **Success Metric:** Replaces manual Excel work

### Resource Constraints

**Risk: Limited Development Time**
â€¢ **Problem:** One developer, many features
â€¢ **Mitigation:**
  - Use existing UI components (shadcn/ui)
  - Deploy early and iterate
  - Focus on highest-value features first

**Risk: Cost Overruns**
â€¢ **Problem:** Cloud services might get expensive
â€¢ **Mitigation:**
  - Use free tiers (Vercel, Neon)
  - Monitor usage weekly
  - Set up billing alerts

### Questions for Further Clarification

As someone new to development, you might want to ask:

â€¢ **What specific calculations** make up the burden rate?
â€¢ **Which employees** should have access to this system?
â€¢ **What happens** if a file has errors or missing data?
â€¢ **How often** should the system check for new files?
â€¢ **Should we keep** historical data forever or archive it?
â€¢ **What reports** do board members specifically need?
â€¢ **Are there compliance** requirements for data storage?
â€¢ **Should different users** see different levels of detail?
