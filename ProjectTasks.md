    step4: 'Clean commit ready';
  };

  qualityGates: {
    codeReview: 'TypeScript ESLint enforcer (mandatory)';
    integration: 'MCP Tools Specialist (when applicable)';
    security: 'Future Security Specialist';
    performance: 'Future Frontend Specialist';
  };

  escalation: {
    blockingIssues: 'Return to developer with detailed feedback';

    complexIssues: 'Multi-agent collaboration';
  };
}
```

### **Development Quality Metrics with Agents**
