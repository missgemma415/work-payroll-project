## Optimization Pattern - $TIMESTAMP

### Frontend Optimizations
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Lazy load components with dynamic imports
- Optimize images with next/image component

### Backend Optimizations
- Implement response caching with proper headers
- Use database connection pooling
- Batch database operations where possible
- Stream large responses

### Build Optimizations
- Enable SWC minification in Next.js
- Tree-shake unused dependencies
- Use production builds for benchmarking
- Implement proper caching strategies
